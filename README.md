Sorting and searching algorithms.

## Description

### Project 1 - Linear Class in C++

This C++ project defines and demonstrates operations on a "Linear" class representing linear equations in the form of "ax + b".
This program includes methods for various linear algebra operations and demonstrates their usage.
The common operations for linear algebra include calculating the root, finding the y-intercept, deriving the equation, scaling by a constant, and comparing slopes.
Lastly, the class supports the addition of two "Linear" objects via the use of operator overloading.

### Project 2 - Linked List Implementation in C++

This C++ project implements a doubly linked list to manage strings. This program includes methods for list insertion and deletion and various operations on the strings, including finding the longest and shortest strings, calculating the average word length, and constructing a sentence from the list.
The function main.cpp contains the implementation of the linked list and a main function to demonstrate its functionality.

### Project 3 - Graph Implementation in C++

This C++ project defines and demonstrates operations on a "Graph" class.
The following functionalities for the "Graph" class are included: build a graph, print its adjacency matrix, find the vertex with the largest degree, and perform a Breadth-First search (BFS).

## How to test

There should be no set-up needed. You should only need to run the three cpp files.

## Personal contribution

All C++ files were my personal contribution.
